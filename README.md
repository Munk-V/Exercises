# Exercises

This repository contains some of my Arduino exercises from the course. I'll be opdatering og adding more as the class goes on. 
I write/test the code in Arduino IDE, and use VS Code to edit files, add Doxygen comments, and manage Git/GitHub.

## Repository structure

The repository is organized into three exercises for now will add more in the furture:

- `exercise-9/`
- `exercise-10/`
- `exercise-11/`

Each exercise may contain multiple Arduino sketches. Arduino IDE typically requires each sketch to be inside a folder with the same name as the `.ino` file, for example:

## Folder layout

```text

exercise-9/
 ├─ Ex9_Scatterplot/
 │  └─ Ex9_Scatterplot.ino
 ├─ Ex9_Temp_V/
 │  └─ Ex9_Temp_V.ino
 └─ Doxyfile

```

## Branches

There is one branch per exercise so each submission can be viewed independently:

- `exercises-9`  → contains only `exercise-9/`
- `exercise-10`  → contains only `exercise-10/`
- `excerise-11`  → contains only `exercise-11/`

main is used as an overview branch with the general structure.

Each exercise folder contains its own Doxyfile (Doxygen configuration).
